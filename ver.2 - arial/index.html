      <strong>The Future of Healthcare Conference</strong> to be held on the <strong>3rd and 4th of March</strong> is an opportunity for change. A change the world is in serious need of. For we stand at a crucial juncture, where the world is facing unprecedented healthcare challenges. One billion people in the world still lack access to healthcare systems. Communicable and infectious diseases are growing at alarming rates and non-communicable diseases amount to almost two-thirds of all deaths worldwide. In fact, diseases kill more people each year than all conflicts and natural or man-made catastrophes put together. <br />
      Therefore, it's the choices we make today, that will determine the future of healthcare in our nations and the world at large. Let's take the right steps to make the world a healthier place for our future to thrive in. It is time for all important healthcare stakeholders to work together to find global solutions that are systemic, sustainable and impactful. It is time to look for a definitive way forward with an action plan to impact the future of healthcare. <br />
      <strong>The Healthcare Alliance</strong> is the coming together of an august set of organisations from important industry bodies to knowledge partners of global eminence, to facilitate deliberation over globally-relevant themes in healthcare. <br />
      In the first conference on <strong>The Future of Healthcare: A Collective Vision</strong>,six important topics will be discussed: <br />
      <ul>
        <li><strong>A framework for primary and preventive health,</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Non-communicable diseases</strong> </li>
        <li><strong>New age health systems for innovation and universal access</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Talent fast-forward: Upskill and upscale</strong> </li>
        <li><strong>Public-private-people partnership to address the huge need for funding</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Hospitals of the future.</strong></li>
      </ul>
      The conference will provide innovative solutions and formulate guidelines for tackling the healthcare challenges faced by the world today. As someone who always inspires change and is at the forefront of healthcare development initiatives, we believe your knowledge and perspective would add tremendous depth to this global exchange of Ideas. <br />
      Your participation is vital to the success of this global initiative. <strong>So block your dates and join us at The Future of Healthcare: A Collective Vision</strong>. Together let us transform healthcare and secure the strength of our nations. </td>
